        After spending 5 years in Japan, I decided it was time to come back home and learn
        some new valuable skills. I naturally choose to learn what i have been passionate
        about for the last few years, IT. I started with an entry level training for 3
        month to understand the basics of network, administration and support. My feelings
        towards IT were growing everyday and I knew I had to go further with my training
        anb chose to become a DevOps Engineer because i both like development and
        operations and becoming a DevOps gave me the tools to discover more and more about
        the two sides of IT that interest me.
